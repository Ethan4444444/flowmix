\usage{
generate_data_generic(
  p = 5,
  TT = 50,
  fac = 1,
  nt = 1000,
  dimdat = 2,
  seed = NULL,
  prob1 = 3/4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Number of covariates.}

\item{TT}{Number of timepoints.}

\item{fac}{Defaults to 1, and determines size of covariance matrix.}

\item{nt}{Number of particles in each time point.}

\item{dimdat}{Dimension of data.}

\item{seed}{Random seed.}

\item{prob1}{Relative abundance for cluster 1 in the first half of the time
points. Defaults to 3/4, in which case the first half of the time points
have cluster relative abundances have a ratio of 6:1:1:0. In the later
half, the fourth cluster appears, and the ratio becomes 6:1:1:1.}
